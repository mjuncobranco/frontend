    <Router>
      <AuthProvider>
        <ScrollToTop />
        <Header />
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
          <Route path="/register" element={<Register />} />
          <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
          <Route path="/contact/message" element={<Contact />} />
          <Route path="/movies/:id" element={<MovieDetail />} />
        </Routes>
        <Footer />
      </AuthProvider>
    </Router>
  );
}

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <MoviesProvider>
      <App />
    </MoviesProvider>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

  - Provides authentication state and methods (e.g., login, logout).
  - Wraps routes that require authentication.

  - Manages the state for movies and favorites.
  - Provides methods to add or remove favorite movies.

2. **Movie Browsing**:
   - View the list of movies on the homepage.
   - Allows user to find movie by filtering by title easily.
   - Click on a movie to view details.

3. **Favorites Management**:

   - Remove movies from the favorites list.

4. **Contact Form**:
